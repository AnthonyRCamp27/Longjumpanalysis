# 🏃‍♂️ Long Jump Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the **evolution of long jump performances** in track and field, highlighting historical trends, world records, Olympic data, and key influencing factors like wind, altitude, and technological advancements.

## 📌 Objectives
- Track the **historical progression** of men’s and women’s long jump world records.
- Analyze **Olympic long jump data** from 1900 to 2024.
- Examine the **impact of environmental factors** such as wind speed and altitude.
- Explore how **technology influences performance measurement** and fairness.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Wikipedia:** World record progression.
- **Kaggle:** Olympic long jump results (2008–2024).
- **Key2Stats:** Historical Olympic data (1900–2008).
- **World Athletics:** Official performance records.

## 🧹 Data Processing
- **Data Merging:** Combined datasets by year and athlete name.
- **Cleaning:** Standardized units, filled missing values, and removed duplicates.
- **Normalization:** Unified naming conventions and corrected errors for accuracy.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Men’s and women’s records show **significant early gains**, plateauing in recent decades.
- **Wind assistance** and **high-altitude venues** can boost jump distances by notable margins.
- **Technological advances** (laser measurement, electronic boards, high-speed cameras) improve fairness and precision.
- Gender trends show a compressed evolution for women due to late Olympic inclusion but rapid performance gains during the mid-20th century.

## 📈 Tools & Techniques
- Public datasets
- Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) *(add specifics if you have your code)*
- Statistical correlation and trend analysis

## ✅ Key Findings
- Elite performance is shaped by a **balance of physical talent, environment, and technology**.
- Historic jumps like Bob Beamon’s (1968) and Mike Powell’s (1991) illustrate the impact of wind and altitude.
- Modern athletes may need **biometric, training, and psychological data analysis** to break longstanding records.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Expand datasets to include biometric and training data.
- Apply **machine learning models** for performance prediction.
- Explore the **psychological impact** on athlete performance.
