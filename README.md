🏃‍♂️ Long Jump Performance Analysis
📄 Project Overview
This project explores the evolution of long jump performances in track and field—analyzing trends in world records, Olympic achievements, and the influence of external variables like wind and altitude. It was completed as a final project to apply data collection, cleaning, and analysis techniques to a real-world topic in sports performance.

📊 What’s Inside
📈 Analysis of world record progression for men and women

🏅 Olympic performance trends from 1900 to 2024

🌬️ Impact of wind and altitude on jump distance

📡 Role of technology in measurement and performance

👥 Gender-based trends and record comparisons

📚 Case studies on legendary jumps (e.g., Mike Powell vs. Bob Beamon)

🧠 Key Insights
Legal wind conditions can increase jump distances by up to 15 cm.

High altitudes (like Mexico City) favor longer jumps due to lower air resistance.

Long jump records have plateaued in recent decades, suggesting biomechanical limits or improved regulation.

Technology has improved precision and fairness in judging results.
